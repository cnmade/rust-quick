```rust

fn main() {
    
// slice: used to reference a contiguous section (subset) of a collection (aarray, etc.) WITHOUT taking ownership of these elements 
// commonly used: string slice dt type : &str
    
// string literals are slices
    
// the data is hard-coded in the executable binary and the program  uses a string slice to access it 
// create a string slice from string data 
// the sentence variable has a pointer to the beginning of the string data in memory as well, as info about its length and capacity
 let sentence = String::from("This is a sequence of words.");
    println!("sentence is {}", sentence); 
// the last_word variable has a pointer to the offset/start index of the section of the string data, as well as the length of the slice
    
// as usual, the end index of the slice is excluded from the result (common in most programming languages when slicing collections) 
let last_word = &sentence[22..22 + 5];          
// [start..end_excluded]
    println!("last_word is \"{}\"", last_word); 
// slice from offset index to end of the collection (here string data) 
let last_part: &str = &sentence[22..];
    println!("last_part is \"{}\"", last_part); 
// slice from beginning of collection up until end index 
let without_last_word = &sentence[..22];
    println!("without_last_word is \"{}\"", without_last_word); 
// the length of a string slice is in number of bytes (usize data type)
    
// NOT in number of characters 
let slice_length: usize = last_part.len();
    println!("slice_length is {} bytes", slice_length); 
// when creating a string slice, the range indices must occur at valid UTF-8 character boundaries
    
// remember that UTF-8 characters can occupy multiple bytes
    
// all this to say that slice range indices must be character boundaries
    
// if you index in the middle of a character, the program will panic
    
// so be careful when creating string slices from strings with special characters or emojis 
// yes, this is some low-level stuff that we usually don't deal with in everyday Node.js

Output
```
sentence is This is a sequence of words.
last_word is "words"
last_part is "words."
without_last_word is "This is a sequence of "
slice_length is 6 bytes
